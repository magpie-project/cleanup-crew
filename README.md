Code for America - Keep Indy Beautiful distributed workforce city cleanup concept

# Description
People sign up and register as effort for their neighborhood and earn a clean up flash-mob for their neighborhood. If people actually participate and help other neighborhoods before their own gets a clean up day.

Volunteers would register and pre-schedule for `n` cleanups (Saturdays spent in other neighborhoods where they've been checked in for full contribution. Their contribution builds up effort for their own neighborhood.

Ideally, this would increase the number of workers ready and willing to work on any given Saturday, increasing the amount of work done on any given Saturday in less time.

The underlying goal behind this is two fold:
1) Neighborhood cleanups
2) Cross neighborhood familirity

Indianapolis is a very splotchy hot and cold distribution of socio-economic groups. They tend to isolate among themselves. I would like to extend the community spirit within each neighborhood across neighborhoods.

Maybe each individual simply works up for their neighborhood. So some people could work as often as they like. Neighborhoods would likely need a project coordinator to assess the needs of the neighborhood before going in to figure out what supplies and how many people they'd need. This represenative should also be able to rally their own neighborhood to help and attend meetings of captains to work on core needs and alignment.

It would be nice to have small groups from each team come together so they don't feel so isolated, but I'd prefer not to have entire neighborhoods descending onto other neighborhoods. Part of the idea is to develop bonds between people in different neighborhoods.

No one knows what neighborhood is up next so they can't ditch out of going somewhere they don't want to go. No one will ever go anywhere unsafe.

Need sponsors to supply: equipment (checked in and out to people on duty who don't bring their own), consumable materials like mulch, food and bev for volunteers, team shirts, vegitation being planted, etc.
